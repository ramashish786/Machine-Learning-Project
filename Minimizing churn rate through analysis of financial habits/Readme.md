Subscription Products often are the main source of revenue for companies across all industries. These
products can come in the form of a 'one size fits all' overcompassing subscription, or in multi-level
memberships. Regardless of how they structure their memberships, or what industry they are in,
companies almost always try to minimize customer churn (a.k.a. subscription cancellations). To retain their
customers, these companies first need to identify behavioral patterns that act as catalyst in
disengagement with the product.

* Market: The target audience is the entirety of a company's subscription base. They are the ones
companies want to keep.

* Product: The subscription products that customers are already enrolled in can provide value that users
may not have imagined, or that they may have forgotten.

* Goal: The objective of this model is to predict which users are likely to churn, so that the company can
focus on re-engaging these users with the product. These efforts can be email reminders about the
benefits of the product, especially focusing on features that are new or that the user has shown to value.
