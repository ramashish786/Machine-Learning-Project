## INTRODUCTION

Lending companies work by analyzing the financial history of their loan applicants, and choosing whether
or not the applicant is too risky to be given a loan. If the applicant is not, the company then determines the
terms of the loan. To acquire these applicants, companies can organically receive them through their
websites/apps, often with the help of advertisement campaigns. Other times, lending companies partner
with peer-to-peer (P2P) lending marketplaces, in order to acquire leads of possible applicants. Some
example marketplaces include Upstart. Lending Tree, and Lending club. In this project. we are going to
asses the 'quality' of the leads our company receives from these marketplaces.

* Market: The target audlence is the set of loan applicants who reached out through an intermediary
marketplace.

* Product A loan.

* Goal: Develop an model to predict for 'quality' applicants. In this case study, 'quality' applicants are those
who reach a key part of the loan application process.
